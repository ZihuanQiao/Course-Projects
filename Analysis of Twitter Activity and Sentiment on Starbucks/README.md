In this work, we try to use Starbucks twitter data to see the twitter activity and sentiment on Starbucks. It is meaningful to see whether this popular coffee- house chain company has good reputation on the social media. This can be helpful for many business purposes.

we will first look at the number of twitter on Starbucks compared with Dunkinâ€™ Donuts and their distribution in the US on a map to see which one is more popular as a topic on social media. Then, we want to show what are people talking about Starbucks when mentioning it on Twitter by using word clouds. Further analysis is related to sentiment analysis. We use ordinal logistic regression to see the relationship between location and sentiment to Starbucks (positive, neutral or negative). Shiny app is used for visualization here. Considering each tweets should have different level of influence of on other users, we also conduct analysis on the variables that can reflect the influence level of a tweet. We use kernel density estimation to get plots of density of the variables and use bootstrap to estimate their sample means.
